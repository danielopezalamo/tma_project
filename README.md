This project has two folders:

* **Data:** It has all the csv files used to train the ML
* **Model:** It has all the code files:
  * _Data Transformation_: It has all the data transformations we used to have the csv we wanted
  * _KNN_: It has the KNN algorithm to predict things.
  * _Random Forest_: It has the Random Forest algorithm to predict things
  * _PCA + Random Forest_: PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a set of correlated 
  variables (p) into a smaller k (k<p) number of uncorrelated variables called principal components. > More info in: [PCA] (https://rukshanpramoditha.medium.com/principal-component-analysis-18-questions-answered-4abd72041ccd)
